Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

A. 0(n) O(n) This is linear time because the loop will run n number of times while a is less than n^3

B. O(n^3) Runs n^3 number of times because the first 3 loops run n number of times. They are nested so they get mulitplied together. We ignore the last loop after we simplify the runtime because it runs a constant amount of times.
